This is based on some slides that I got from David Weisman about a study
he did of similarity between pages on PubMed. I'm not sure I'm doing this
right, as it takes quite a bit of time. But each paper is reduced to a
vector of relatively few integers (50 or 100 or 1000) and we simply count
which components are equal by position, and that count is the similarity.
